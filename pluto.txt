 To be, or not to be- that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 1750
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- 
No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 1755
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation 
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep. 
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! 
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 1760
Must give us pause. There's the respect 
That makes calamity of so long life. 
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, 1765
The insolence of office, and the spurns 
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, 
When he himself might his quietus make 
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, 
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 1770
But that the dread of something after death- 
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn 
No traveller returns- puzzles the will, 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
Than fly to others that we know not of? 1775
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, 
And thus the native hue of resolution 
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, 
And enterprises of great pith and moment 
With this regard their currents turn awry 1780
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! 
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons 
Be all my sins rememb'red.
